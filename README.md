Project: Library App  
--> use object constructor  
--> display objects (books)  
--> provide method for adding new books to the library  
  
I worked on this application a couple different times (with quite a bit of time between). I got fairly stymied once (saved as lib.js), put it away for a few months, then tried again (hence the 2.0.js).  
  
What I'd like to improve:  
--> I'm somewhat happy with the display, but feel like it could still improve.  
--> I wouldn't be surprised if my JS code is rather verbose/excessive and could be condensed/streamlined. Not bad for early in the learning process, but I'm excited to improve.  
--> could I have event listeners on the prototype bookCard, so that each card would inherit them? (Would that work?) Figuring out the listeners (particularly when you add new book cards to the display) took me a long while to sort out.
